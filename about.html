					<span class="h2">Oh, sure, haha, just a bit embarassed by your attention</span>
					<p>I currently work at Facebook AI Research as an AI Resident (read: Research Engineer). Before that, I finished joint a Master program between three European Universities - Norwegian University of Science and Technology, University of Granada, and the University of Lyon - where I studied Applied Computer Science with a concentration on Imaging, Computer Vision, and Color Science. During my study, I also interned at amazing groups at the University of Oxford (UK) and KU Leuven (Belgium) and worked as a Teaching and Research Assistant at NTNU.</p> 

<p>I also studied Physics at my undergrad, but only during my Master I actually discovered that work may be fun and things don't need to be super complex and boring to be useful. This, and also the fact of being in the academic environment, motivated me to develop fast as the researcher, which eventually lead to publishing 14 peer-reviewed papers at the end of my 2-year program from the point where I knew nothing about Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and the world.</p>

<p>I wanted to keep that spirit of excitement and to grow further as a first-class researcher but once I reached the level of real-world research frontier it turned out to be much more complex and harsh than it was beneficial ... just ... just as ... Physics, which I tried to escape so hard!</p>

<p>So now I want to concentrate on the stuff I noticed to like the most:  working with data, designing visualizations, complaining about crappy software, making rational decisions and making the impact others can see. Which brings me to... no, not the loudest person in the internet argument, but right,  Product/Data Analytics, where I try to grow now.</p>
